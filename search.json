      "content"  : "Describe three principles of direct manipulation.The first principle of direct manipulation is, “continuous representations of the objects and actions of interest with meaningful visual metaphors.” This means that while interacting with the system, there should always be visual feedback that coincides with what you are trying to accomplish with the interface. The second is, “physical actions or presses of labeled buttons, instead of complex syntax.” This means that instead of giving the user a language or another tool for communication with the system, the system should have an interface that reflects real-life controls, such as physical buttons or actions. The third is, “rapid, incremental, reversible actions whose effects on the objects of interest are visible immediately.” This means that changes should occur in real-time, but be undoable in order to give the user maximum control.  Give four benefits of direct manipulation. Also list four problems of direct manipulation.One benefit of direct manipulation is that it reflects the real world so users should, ideally, already know how to interact with it. Another benefit is that direct manipulation systems make you feel more in control because they respond faster. Furthermore, direct manipulation systems also try to take advantage of as many of your senses as possible so that you feel more connected to it. One more benefit is that user satisfaction increases because the user feels more in control of the outcome.One problem of direct manipulation is that sometimes it leads to overcomplicating the system. For example, sometimes text is the most efficient interface to interact with. Also, direct manipulation systems generally consume all of the user’s focus so that they cannot use multiple programs at once. Furthermore, sometimes the visual representations used by the system are not intuitive, so users have to learn them.  Examining the success of video games can provide insight for interface designers. Explain what lessons can be learned by videogames for interface design, but also provide examples of areas where it is ineffective to do so.Videogames have mastered the art of using 3D worlds as an interface. Therefore, it would be beneficial to look at videogames as an example of good 3D representations.  However, videogames are entertainment programs and not practical devices, so they are not as good models for how to make a practical system.  An airline company is designing a new on-line reservation system. They want to add some direct-manipulation features. For example, they would like customers to click a map to specify the departure cities and the destinations, and to click on the calendar to indicate their schedules. From your point of view, list four benefits and four problems of the new idea compared with their old system, which required the customer to do the job by typing text.Four advantages of the map and calendar is that 1. Many users might find it more intuitive to navigate the interface this way. 2. Some users might not know the name of the airport they need to go to, so they can see all airports in the region they want to travel to and then click it. 3. The calendar could help them precisely choose the date and time they would like to travel. 4. The calendar could help prevent them from mis-scheduling.Four disadvantages are 1. It would in some cases be faster to select the correct airport from a list. 2. It would be faster in some case to manually type in the time and date you’d like to travel. 3. It might be harder to find the correct airport from a map. 4. People might choose the wrong time and date from a calendar.  List a few guidelines for an effective 3D interface:An effective 3D interface has instant feedback, logical representations.  List an example of teleoperation or virtual reality. Consider what a future application (that does not presently exist) might do. Be creative!"

      "content"  : "Consider additional requirements and technology to further complicate your analysis of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) design:Use eye-tracker data to further analyze the productEye-tracker data could show us where users look first when they use the interface which would allow us to better place the key features they are looking for in the places they look firstConsider accessibility (universal usability) issues such as lighting, physical placement of ATM, etc.The ATM should be placed on ground level (not raised or lowered) so that users do not have to crane their posture up or down to interact with it. Also it should be in a well-lit environment so that users can correctly see the interface they are using. Furthermore the ATM should be placed in its own space, away from other things people want to use so that users are not crammed into a space and so that, if a queue of users forms to use it, they do not block the paths of others.Consider user profile issues, e.g. is this the first time a user is using an ATM?Perhaps to help new users, if more than a couple of user errors occur, the interface should begin to display non-intrusive help messages to guide them towards their goal.Requirement to perform beta and/or market tests?Positioning and lighting of the environment of the ATM could be tested in control groups to find the most preferred setup of the ATM by users.Are there other stress factors such as a looming time deadline or a personal safety issue?One stress factor users might encounter is if they are using the ATM while a large queue has formed behind them or if they have waited a long time to use the ATM. The frustration of waiting a long time and the stress of wanting to use the ATM quickly so others can use the machine will cause the users to make more mistakes and have less pleasant experiences.Review the iOS Human Interface Guidelines in the iOS Developer Library at: https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/1) select one guideline that makes perfect sense and seems easy to incorporate into a designIn my opinion, clarity is the most logical of the guidelines. It is straight-forward to have a guideline which asks the developer to make things easier to read, see, and interact with.2) select another guideline that is much less clear requiring further explanation or analysis to incorporate into a design.The deference guideline sounds much more abstract and harder to implement. For example, it asks the developer to make subjective improvements to the interface such as being "beautiful" and "easy to understand."At present, the drive to use Big Data to define or enhance corporate strategies seems to be a global business trend. State an example of where this data can improve a business, focusing on user interface aspects.One could examine big data such as user click positions, eye-tracking data, and so on from mass repositories and try to find trending key points where people look and click in order to find better places to position elements.Cite a past experience where user interface development methods might apply to another system development activity that might not have a strong user interface component."

      "content"  : "Describe at least three different types of expert review methods.Heuristic evaluation is where experts review an interface and decide whether or not it conforms to well-established rules, such as the Eight Golden Rules. Guidelines review is where the interface is reviewed in order to see if it conforms to the guidelines established by the organization. Consistency inspection is when the interface is compared to other interfaces in order to check for consistent fonts, formats, schemes, and other details.  Compare and contrast controlled psychological experiments and usability tests in the evaluation process of user interfaces. Be sure to include the benefits and limitations of each.In a psychological experiment, the method of testing the interface is more empirical: one gathers evidence for or against the usability of the interface through surveys and other techniques. However, it is harder to use psychological experiments because you have to find very specific things about the interface to test and a sample of users who match the demographic of users who will see the interface. In a usability test, however, the tests are more subjective. One can ask the user, “Did you enjoy using the interface,” for example. However, usability tests are less empirical.  Give two reasons why expert reviews are useful. Also give two limitations of expert reviews.Expert reviews are useful because usability experts are trained to know exactly what to look for in an interface and how to find it quickly to make sure it is high quality. One limitation of expert reviews is that the expert might not fully understand the scope of the project and might not give advice geared towards the actual desired functionality. Also, the expert might not be familiar with the user group who is intended to use the product and might make suggestions which are irrelevant to them.For questions 5-7, refer to the following instructions:One argument against the current interface design of a popular word processor is that it has all the functional menu items appearing together which cause the interface to be too complex. This complexity results in a confusing and frustrating experience for novice users. An alternative design is to provide different levels of functional complexity, so users can choose the level that is suitable for them, then advance to higher level as they get familiar with the tool, thus feel more comfortable and learn more efficiently. You are asked to conduct usability testing to compare these two designs.  Which type of usability testing should be used for this situation? Explain why.Competitive usability testing should be use to compare the new version of the interface which allows you to move up to higher levels of complexity to the old interface which does not. This would allow for a good side-by-side comparison of the usability of each version.  List some general principles of subject selection in usability testing. How should you select subjects for this case?It would make sense to pick a group of familiar users and a group of unfamiliar users and find how they feel about hiding parts of the interface. One reason for this is that the advanced users might be unhappy that the features they like to use are hidden. Also, it is important to see if the unfamiliar users wish that they could see some of the more advanced features.  List and briefly describe the steps in the usability testing you would conduct.I would create a survey of possible problems or benefits the users might find and ask them to rate how they believe the product stacks up. For example, if they thought there was not enough buttons on the page, there would be a spot for them to mark that they were dissatisfied with the number of buttons on the page."

      "content"  : "You are the new Chief Design Officer (CDO) of a new start-up, DTUI Inc. The project is to design a system for hospitals that will allow receptionists to check in people at the hospital faster. They wish to develop an interface that meets both the receptionist and patient’s needs. Describe in detail a design methodology of 4 stages to facilitate proper design of such a system.Write your answer in the form of a management plan for this project. For each stage, indicate the number of weeks that should be allocated. Hint: note the four phases of the design process:Requirements analysisPreliminary (conceptual) and detailed designBuild and implementationEvaluationDuring the requirements analysis stage of this project, I would interview patients and receptionists and try to find what they believe would get them into the hospital faster and most conveniently. Also, I would observe and analyze patients checking in to the hospital as well as receptionists guiding the check in in order to try to find flaws and trouble they might not have identified themselves. During the preliminary and detailed design stage, my team would compose diagrams and conceptualizations of our chosen solution to the problem. In the build and implementation phase, we would begin the implementation of our chosen solution. Lastly, we would determine the effectiveness of our solution in the evaluation phase.The State of Maryland is developing a web-voting interface. For selecting the candidates, one design (RB) is a set of radio buttons and another is (CB) a combo-box (drops down when selecting the scroll arrow icon), both using standard fonts at 10-point size.  Compare these two designs when there are 4 candidates and predict the relative speed of performance and error rates. Support your choice by a thoughtful argument.In a race with only four candidates, the radio button group greatly outperforms the combo-box because it is easier to see the choices and it is more clear which selection you have made. A combo-box is a better fit for many selections to where you would need to scroll to find the candidate you were looking for. If you used a combo-box in this example, it might make the users think that there were supposed to be many candidates to choose from, but only four are listed.  An expert reviewer complains that both designs may work with young users who are familiar and expert in using a mouse, but that there will be problems for elderly and motor-impaired users who have difficulty controlling a mouse. The reviewer recommends a new design that includes a larger font (20-point size) and a numbered list to allow selection by keyboard easily. Describe a Participatory Design or Social Impact Statement process that might clarify this issue with elderly users.A social impact statement process might look like the company announcing through social media that they have decided to re-design their voting interface with the elderly in mind.  Design an experiment to help resolve the issue brought up in Question 3. Assume you have substantial resources and access to subjects.To test the expert reviewer’s hypothesis that elderly and motor-impaired users would prefer larger font and a numbered keyboard selection, a simulation could be held with an elderly individual with those changes implemented to see if they have an easier time navigating the interface.  Provide a definition of participatory design. Give three arguments for and three arguments against participatory design.Participatory design is part of the design process which aims at involving everyone who will be affected by the final product being developed. For example, if you are developing a product for people at a steel plant, you would get the operators involved in the design process.  Consider a system that dos not yet exist. An example is a totally automated fast-food restaurant, where customers order via touch screen interactions, pay by swiping their debit or credit cards, and then pick up their food–analogous to the self-check-out at some supermarkets, but even more extreme. Discuss how you conduct a contextual inquiry for a system that does not yet exist.You would have to make a believable simulation of the restaurant for interviewees to experience. For example, in the interview room, you could have the users buy a cheese burger by interacting with a dumbed-down touch screen (which they might even have to imagine works) and then give them the cheese burger when they have completed the checkout process. Then, you could interview them and get their thoughts and feelings on the process."

      "content"  : "Give a brief explanation of the Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design. State an example you have seen on a device, computer interface or web site that violates those rules.The Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design guide interface designers in creating consistent, universally usable, feedback-driven, error-handling, non-destructive, focused, and easy to understand  interfaces. An example of an interface which I have seen violate the Golden Rules is Facebook, which constantly re-arranges and reformats key components of the site and makes the user re-learn how to use it every time they visit.  Don Norman suggests organizing screens and menus functionally, designing commands and menu choices to be distinctive, and making it difficult for users to take irreversible actions. Norman also says to provide feedback about the state of the interface (e.g., changing the cursor to show whether a map interface is in zoom-in or select mode) and designing for consistency of actions (e.g., ensuring that Yes/No buttons are always displayed in the same order). State one example you have seen where you know these rules have been violated. Although this is crucial to a user interfaces success, suggest why there may be challenges to implement some of Norman’s guidelines.The re-designed MyBama website hides the side menu when you shrink the browser window. However, there is no way to access the side-bar without resizing the window and there is nothing on the page to suggest you are in an altered state.  Clarify the difference among guidelines, principles and theories.Guidelines are agreed-upon (either inside a group or organization or universally) standards which can speed up and improve the result of the development process by refining the goals of development. Principles are essentially guidelines which are treated as fact for the type of interface being designed. However, theories are explanation and interpretations of why or how design should work.  What are “accessibility guidelines”? Discuss progress from organization(s) that are taking the lead. State a few example guidelines.Accessibility guidelines instruct how to make interfaces and content more accessible with an emphasis on users with disabilities. Major Operating System and software vendors are creating systems which are designed to be usable despite any physical ailments such as blindness or hearing loss. For example, text-to-speech and speech-to-text software is integrated in Mac OS and Windows OS and has been for many years. Accessibility guidelines from the Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS include making every user interface element in an app interactive via VoiceOver commands, making sure information is concise and helpful, and creating useful labels and hints (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/iPhoneAccessibility/Making_Application_Accessible/Making_Application_Accessible.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008785-CH102-SW5).  What is the difference between micro-HCI theories and macro-HCI theories?Micro-HCI theories focus on the usability of existing technology and interfaces in order to make using interfaces more enjoyable. However, macro-hci theories focus on developing interfaces with change the feelings experienced by the user while using the interface."

      "content"  : "Describe three populations of users with special needs. For each of these populations, suggest three ways current interfaces could be improved to better serve them.Three populations of users with special needs which could need enhanced user interfaces are people who are hearing-impaired, sight-impaired, or movement-impaired. People with damaged or lack of hearing need interfaces which do not rely on that sense to function. Therefore, an interface which cues users with a ‘ding’ sound when an event takes place might consider pairing the noise with a blinking element on the screen or another visual way of getting one’s attention. For those with impaired or no vision, navigating and using the interface cannot rely on sight to function. Using an ATM as an example interface, interfaces could be improved through narrative prompts letting users know what actions are available to them and either brail atop the buttons which control those actions or verbal control of those actions. Movement-impaired individuals need interfaces which do not necessarily require them to move in order to interact with the system. For these users in the ATM example, audio control might be a way to allow them better access to the system without making them perform impossible or uncomfortable tasks.  Suppose you need to design a system for users in both the United States and Japan. Present a list of cultural differences that you should be aware of so that a successful design can be made.One difference that a system in Japan would need as apposed to a system in the United States is that it would need to display text from right to left as opposed to left to right. Also, in Japan one’s title (such as Mr, CEO, Dr, etc.) means more than it does in the United States.  In certain interfaces, it is necessary to inform users of an abnormal condition or time-dependent information. It is important that the display of this information catches the user’s attention. Suggest five ways a designer can successfully attract attention.Designers can attract attention through blinking, use of colors which are bold or different than the other colors on the screen, using different fonts than the standard font, size of font or elements on the screen, and use of audio.  Name a piece of software you often use where it is easy to produce an error. Explain ways you could improve the interface to better prevent errors.Pokémon Go gives errors all the time and sometimes does not work, but gives no error to tell you what to do. Most of the errors involve client-server communication issues and there might not be a simple fix for stopping the errors completely. However, the software should show a better explanation of the problem to the user and better instructions of what to do when you see the error. For example, if the problem is that the server is over-loaded, the app might show you the message “Could not log in.” Instead, it would be better if the software told you an understandable reason of why you could not log in such as “The server is down. Please wait before trying again,” so that the user does not attempt to log back in in vain.  List some human physiological or psychological factors that can influence human operator performance.Being tired, frustrated, or confused lead to human errors."

Make an effort to see the parts of their work which your interface can make easier. Ask the people what they would like to see in an interface.Step three: Construct a theoretical interface and present it to the potential users of the interface. If the users find the interface unsatisfactory, re-construct it until an acceptable interface has been made.Step four: Develop the skeleton of the interface which works with fake data and see if the test users can use it intuitively or if they struggle to understand the interface. Make changes to the skeleton as necessary and represent it until the users are comfortable with the experience.Step five: Connect the user interface into the data to make a fully functional prototype of the final interface. Let users test the interface in this stage. Use this time to find flaws in the design that can be changed before the final release.Step six: Release the completed interface to the users.  List some characteristics of successful user interface designers with respect to their approach to solving UI problemsSuccessful user interface designers are empathetic to the users of their products. They are not just thinking about the slickest or sexiest user interface they can design, but the one that is the least distracting and the most helpful in accomplishing the task at hand.  As noted in the book, some skeptics feel that accommodating diversity requires dumbing-down or lowest-common-denominator strategies. However, the authors claim that in their experience, rethinking interface designs to accommodate these diversity situations will result in a better product for all users. Give an example of a product that meets the specific needs of a certain group of people, yet gives all users a better experience.My Mac’s operating system has certain accessibility features which most users do not need to use. However the presence of some of these features, such as speaking the contents of the screen, are useful to everyone sometimes regardless of disability. For example, when trying to read a lot of dense information, sometimes I turn on the feature to speak what is on the screen and it makes my experience more enjoyable.  List several reasons why certain people resist using computers and suggest possible ways to you can alleviate these concerns.A big reason I have seen people shy away from computers is for feeling ‘too stupid’ to use computers. In reality, the people feel stupid because of bad experiences from using complicated or even broken interfaces. When interfaces usability improves, people will stop resisting the use of computers in their work and start seeking them out.  Suggest three usability measures that can be directly used to produce a practical evaluation of a system. Keep the goals of efficiency and satisfaction in mind with these measures.Usability measures that can be used to produce practical evaluation of a system include: Time required to learn the interface, the speed of the interface’s performance, and the amount of errors incurred by the user."
