# Ch 7

+ Feelings that result from good interfaces
  + Ease in learning
  + Sense of mastery
  + enjoyment
  + competency
  + retention
  + eager to show others
  + desire to explore the interface
  + Audio 0:04:16.445987
+ How does this relate to eight golden rules?
  + Audio 0:06:08.520121
  + Eight golden rules
    + strive for consistency
    + universal usability
    + informative feedback
    + closure
    + reduce errors
    + easy reversal
    + user in control
    + reduce short term memory
  + Shared
    + All of the feelings generated by good interface are things that map back to the eight golden rules

## Direct manipulation

### Benefits

+ Audio 0:11:37.896001
+ easy to learn
  + natural
+ proper feedback
+ rapid use
+ metaphor should prevent errors

### Examples

+ Audio 0:12:41.234016
+ Desktop
  + matches what you see on an actual desk
+ Google Maps
  + touch the map and it moves like a globe
+ translational distance

### Problems

+ Audio 0:15:47.581942
+ overcomplicating
+ implementation difficulties
+ visual clutter
+ small margin of error
+ not as universally usable
+ zooming and such might prevent you from seeing other features

### More examples

+ video games
+ CAD tools
+ Kiosks
+ Touch screens
+ GPS in general

### Video 1

+ [Desktop metaphor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UtlOgkOGy4)
+ Audio 0:22:47.725187
+ part of building interfaces is doing things that map to what people already do because it's easier to learn
  + It's a tradeoff

### Airline Company Discussion Question

+ "An airline company is designing a new on-line reservation system. They want to add some direct-manipulation features. For example, they would like customers to click a map to specify the departure cities and the destinations, and to click on the calendar to indicate their schedules. From your point of view, list four benefits and four problems of the new idea compared with their old system, which required the customer to do the job by typing text."

| benefits | problems |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Encourage people to explore the places they might want to go | having too much information might prevent the users from seeing things like special offers and such |
| A user might know where they're going on the map, but not know the name of the place they're going | A user might not know where they're going on the map, but know the name of the place they're going. |
| Reduce the formatting you have to do in order to check the date and location input | |
| You can show users prices at the same time that they pick out their location | |

### 2D and 3D Interfaces

+ Audio 0:30:08.766829
+ Considerations for which interface makes the most sense
  + What are you trying to represent?
  + Time and money resources
    + 3D takes more time
  + How much information the user wants to see

### 3D Execution

+ The desktop is technically 3D
  + Things are behind each-other, etc.
+ Audio 0:32:11.659850
+ Don't distract people with too much eye-candy
+ Keep manipulation of objects straight-forward

### Teleoperation / Telepresence

+ Drones
+ Medical field
  + Avatar doctor
  + Audio 0:35:20.389707
+ Business
  + Teleconference
  + Skype

### Video 2

+ Audio 0:36:28.113523

### Augmented Reality

+ [Robo doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb79-_hGLkc)
+ Examples
  + pokemon go
  + Google glass
  + 10 yard line in football

| direct manipulation principle 1 | continuous representations of the objects and actions of interest with meaningful visual metaphors |
| direct manipulation principle 2 | physical actions or presses of labeled buttons, instead of complex syntax |
| direct manipulation principle 3 | rapid, incremental, reversible actions whose effects on the objects of interest are visible immediately |
| translational distance | a measure of how good the metaphor of a direct manipulation system is |
| problems of direct manipulation | overcomplicating, implementation difficulty, clutter, not as universally usable |
| 3D best practices | don't distract users and keep manipulation of objects straight-forward |
