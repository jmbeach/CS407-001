1. Give a brief explanation of the Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design. State an example you have seen on a device, computer interface or web site that violates those rules.



The Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design guide interface designers in creating consistent, universally usable, feedback-driven, error-handling, non-destructive, focused, and easy to understand  interfaces. An example of an interface which I have seen violate the Golden Rules is Facebook, which constantly re-arranges and reformats key components of the site and makes the user re-learn how to use it every time they visit.




2. Don Norman suggests organizing screens and menus functionally, designing commands and menu choices to be distinctive, and making it difficult for users to take irreversible actions. Norman also says to provide feedback about the state of the interface (e.g., changing the cursor to show whether a map interface is in zoom-in or select mode) and designing for consistency of actions (e.g., ensuring that Yes/No buttons are always displayed in the same order). State one example you have seen where you know these rules have been violated. Although this is crucial to a user interfaces success, suggest why there may be challenges to implement some of Norman’s guidelines.




The re-designed MyBama website hides the side menu when you shrink the browser window. However, there is no way to access the side-bar without resizing the window and there is nothing on the page to suggest you are in an altered state.


3. Clarify the difference among guidelines, principles and theories.




Guidelines are agreed-upon (either inside a group or organization or universally) standards which can speed up and improve the result of the development process by refining the goals of development. Principles are essentially guidelines which are treated as fact for the type of interface being designed. However, theories are explanation and interpretations of why or how design should work.

4. What are “accessibility guidelines”? Discuss progress from organization(s) that are taking the lead. State a few example guidelines.




Accessibility guidelines instruct how to make interfaces and content more accessible with an emphasis on users with disabilities. Major Operating System and software vendors are creating systems which are designed to be usable despite any physical ailments such as blindness or hearing loss. For example, text-to-speech and speech-to-text software is integrated in Mac OS and Windows OS and has been for many years. Accessibility guidelines from the Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS include making every user interface element in an app interactive via VoiceOver commands, making sure information is concise and helpful, and creating useful labels and hints (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/iPhoneAccessibility/Making_Application_Accessible/Making_Application_Accessible.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008785-CH102-SW5).




5. What is the difference between micro-HCI theories and macro-HCI theories?




Micro-HCI theories focus on the usability of existing technology and interfaces in order to make using interfaces more enjoyable. However, macro-hci theories focus on developing interfaces with change the feelings experienced by the user while using the interface.
