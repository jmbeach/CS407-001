# Announcements

+ Class next Tuesday is for meeting with your group
  + Project part C due that day

# Timely user interfaces

## Difference Between Quick and Long Response

+ Long delays
  + Negative
    + users forget
  + Positive
    + make less mistakes to avoid wait times
+ Short delays
  + Negative
    + More error prone
      + Users might become rushed
      + Perceived less error because of quick response time
  + Positive
    + users can learn
    + keep users' attention

## SRT

+ Audio 0:07:49.928513
+ system response time - number of seconds between a user's activity to the display of the results
+ model

+ Audio 0:13:48.149731
+ You want to maximize the SRT time
  + This means moving the computer begins output line as far left as possible
  + Means displaying spinning wheel or whatever to let the user know information is being processed

## Rapid Task Performance, Low Error Rate, High Satisfaction

+ Audio 0:16:27.172385
+ What is needed for this
  + user knowledge
  + ease of navigation
  + solutions can be carried out without delays
  + distractions eliminated
  + anxiety low
    + Audio 0:19:12.712080
    + Avoiding or handling errors
    + user knowledge
  + accurate feedback
  + avoid or handle errors

+ Audio 0:22:21.264087
+ There are actually times you might want to slow down your interface
  + For novices especially

## User Productivity and Variability

+ Audio 0:24:39.577520
+ Repetitive tasks
  + Menial tasks
    + If the system response time is different every time, it will confuse users
    + Short response will make them respond more quickly which could be good or bad
+ Users adapt to the response time
  + If the response time changes, users will change their work style
+ People like predictability

## Frustration Reduction

+ Audio 0:27:42.154803
+ SRT should match expectations
  + If I move the mouse, it should move
  + If I'm doing something more complicated, it's okay if it takes a long time
+ Reduce interruptions
+ Make sure the interface doesn't fail
+ Show progress
  + Make sure it's accurate
+ Improve training
+ Increase capacity
  + Upload speed
  + Response time

## Guidelines

+ Audio 0:35:33.221472
+ People prefer shorter response times
+ SRT < 15 seconds
+ Shorter response time = shorter think time
  + error rates
+ SRT should be appropriate for the task
  + Typing, mouse, etc should be < 15 ms
  + Complex tasks
    + 2 - 4 seconds
  + Very complex
    + < 15 seconds
+ Rapid startups
  + If it takes too long to load, people might go somewhere else

# Vocab

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| short delay positives | users learn better and their attention is kept better |
| long delays negative | users forget what they're doing |
| long delays positive | users make less mistakes |
| short delays negative | users are more error prone |
| system response time (SRT) | number of seconds between a user's activity to the display of the results |
| characteristics needed for rapid task performance, low error rate, and high satisfaction | user knowledge of the task, ease of navigation, solutions have low delay, user has low anxiety, give accurate feedback, avoid or handle errors |
| what can we do to reduce frustration? | Match SRT with expectations, reduce interruptions, prevent errors, keep SRT < 5 seconds, show progress, feedback, improve training, increase capacity |
| response time guidelines | people prefer shorter response times, SRT < 15 sec, SRT should be appropriate for task, rapid load |
