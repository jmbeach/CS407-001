+ Planned permanence
  + short < --- > long
+ scale
  + 2 < ---- > n
+ # communities
  + 0 < --- > n
+ nascence
  + routine < --- > developing

# Differentiate the roles of face-to-face encounters and collaborative interfaces. Explain the limitations and benefits of each type of communication.

+ Audio 0:20:26.274459
+ Face-to-face is good to get to know each-other, to get a big project off the ground, etc.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| synchronicity | the degree of being in sync of a collaborative interface. asynchronous on the low end and synchronous on the high end |
| physical distribution | measures the distance between collaborators in a collaborative interface (in the same location on the low end, not in the same location on the high end) |
| turnover | describes how long a user will keep using the interface (once or more) |
| planned permanence | describes how long the interface will actually be available (will we always have video chat?) |
| scale | number of participants in a collaborative interface |
| # communities | describes the grouping of a collaborative interface (think reddit) |
| nascence | describes how developed a collaborative interface is (email vs teleconference) |
| face-to-face vs collaborative interfaces | face-to-face is good to get to know your teammates to get projects off the ground, but collaborative interfaces are fine for the grunt work of the project |
| Crowd-sourcing examples | wikipedia, kickstarter, mechanical turk |
