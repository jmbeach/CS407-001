  + What jumped out at you?
  + Iterative design
  + Audio 0:04:29.375915
  + You have to think about non-obvious use cases such as poor lighting
  + Video taping responses to the system
  + Eye-tracker
    + You get to see where the user's attention is at all times
      + You could see if there's something distracting
      + You can see how long it takes for people to hone in on what they're looking for
      + Do the users look at the screen when they should look at the keypad (vice versa)
  + Other improvements
    + use-case testing
      + security issues
      + line formed
