| difference between guidelines, principles, and theories | Guidelines are low-level, practical designs, principles are more abstract, and theories are even more abstract that try to make the design process easier |
| guidelines | Make interfaces more consistent, are implemented from practical experience, and from studies |
| important guidelines | consistent data display, reduce memory load, use appropriate methods of getting attention, and facilitate data entry |
| persona | types of users you are designing for on a given project |
| factors of a persona | age, experience, origin or ethnicity, purpose for using software |
| 508 compliance | means all users, regardless of disability status, can access technology |
| 8 golden rules | prevent errors, universal usability, consistency, offer informative feedback, design dialogs to yield closure, keeping users in control, prevent short-term memory load, and reversible |
