## Websites

+ Cool features don't make your app easier to use
+ When do you apply certain features
  + Simpler is sometimes better

## Examples when filling in forms and using menus is easier than direct-manipulation

+ Audio 0:02:31.320854
+ When you have a lot of specific kinds of data
+ Searching is better with an input box
+ When you need high precision

## How can we allow users to select things

+ Audio 0:05:05.312498
+ Binary menus
+ Radio buttons
+ Check boxes
+ Trees
+ Sliders
  + Range of input
+ Pull-down menus / combo-box
+ palettes
+ ribbons
  + Allows for context specific actions
+ shortcuts
+ gestures
  + size of screen matters

## Considerations for smaller screens

+ Audio 0:13:13.823219
+ Data Entry
  + Don't make things too small
  + Easier to overload the user
+ Font size
+ Layout
+ Interruptions
  + User can get a text or a call in the middle of working through a form
  + Need to save state

+ Hilariously hard to navigate

## Audio Menus

+ Audio 0:51:29.693806
+ You can't have to many submenus
+ It's not visible
  + You don't know if your option is even there

## Filling out forms

+ Audio 0:55:43.507105
+ If you fill out a field incorrectly, it might highlight it
  + Does it happen immediately or after submit, etc
+ E-mail for closure
+ Modal vs non-modal forms
  + modal won't let you do anything until you've interacted with it.
