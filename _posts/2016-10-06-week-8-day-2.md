# vocab

| term | definition |
| --- | --- |
| good scenarios for voice assistants | driving, hands occupied, the voice command is simple, entertainment, poor lighting |
| bad scenarios for voice assistants | when you're in public, when it's noisy, the search is complicated, you need to give it names |
| obstacles of speech recognition | noisy environments, poor quality microphones, accents, dialects, learning commands, error correction |
| obstacles to speech production | privacy, pace of speech, pronunciation, short-lived |
| format synthesis | speech generated using algorithms |
| concatenated synthesis | created using speech fragments (pasted together) |
| canned speech | speech that has been pre-recorded |
| when is command language better than a GUI? | For expert users, programming, or inputting complicated data |
