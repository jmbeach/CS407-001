1. Devise an outline, consistent with the scientific method, which interface researchers should follow to validate their designs.

Step one: Find a problem or domain which needs an interface.
Step two: Research the problem by talking with and observing people working on that problem without the interface. Make an effort to see the parts of their work which your interface can make easier. Ask the people what they would like to see in an interface.
Step three: Construct a theoretical interface and present it to the potential users of the interface. If the users find the interface unsatisfactory, re-construct it until an acceptable interface has been made.
Step four: Develop the skeleton of the interface which works with fake data and see if the test users can use it intuitively or if they struggle to understand the interface. Make changes to the skeleton as necessary and represent it until the users are comfortable with the experience.
Step five: Connect the user interface into the data to make a fully functional prototype of the final interface. Let users test the interface in this stage. Use this time to find flaws in the design that can be changed before the final release.
Step six: Release the completed interface to the users.

2. List some characteristics of successful user interface designers with respect to their approach to solving UI problems

Successful user interface designers are empathetic to the users of their products. They are not just thinking about the slickest or sexiest user interface they can design, but the one that is the least distracting and the most helpful in accomplishing the task at hand.

3. As noted in the book, some skeptics feel that accommodating diversity requires dumbing-down or lowest-common-denominator strategies. However, the authors claim that in their experience, rethinking interface designs to accommodate these diversity situations will result in a better product for all users. Give an example of a product that meets the specific needs of a certain group of people, yet gives all users a better experience.

My Mac's operating system has certain accessibility features which most users do not need to use. However the presence of some of these features, such as speaking the contents of the screen, are useful to everyone sometimes regardless of disability. For example, when trying to read a lot of dense information, sometimes I turn on the feature to speak what is on the screen and it makes my experience more enjoyable.

4. List several reasons why certain people resist using computers and suggest possible ways to you can alleviate these concerns.

A big reason I have seen people shy away from computers is for feeling 'too stupid' to use computers. In reality, the people feel stupid because of bad experiences from using complicated or even broken interfaces. When interfaces usability improves, people will stop resisting the use of computers in their work and start seeking them out.

5. Suggest three usability measures that can be directly used to produce a practical evaluation of a system. Keep the goals of efficiency and satisfaction in mind with these measures.

Usability measures that can be used to produce practical evaluation of a system include: Time required to learn the interface, the speed of the interface's performance, and the amount of errors incurred by the user.
